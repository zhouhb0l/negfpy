# Benchmark Note

Kept benchmark figure:
- `Tw_benchmark_match.png`

This figure reflects the finalized consistent setup:
- IFC mass normalization enabled (`mass_mode = ifc` for physical units)
- Nyquist term drop optional (default off)
- Nyquist longest-range +/- symmetry enforcement enabled for numerical stability
- Legacy Fortran reference overlaid for agreement check

Removed files were intermediate/diagnostic plots and temporary comparison data generated during debugging.
