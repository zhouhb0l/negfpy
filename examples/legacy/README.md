# Legacy Examples

This folder contains archived example scripts preserved for reference.

- `examples_ifc/`: older material-specific IFC workflows now superseded by `examples/run_ifc_bulk.py`
- `toy_models/`: small educational/model demos

These scripts may still run, but they are not maintained as the primary user path.
